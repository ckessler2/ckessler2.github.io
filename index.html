<p>Welcome to my site! I'm a second year PhD student at the <a href="https://www.edinburgh-robotics.org/">Edinburgh Centre for Robotics</a>, working in the <a href="https://laiv.uk/">LAIV</a>  and <a href="https://voilab.eng.ed.ac.uk/">VoiLab</a>  under Professors <a href="https://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~ek19/">Ekaterina Komendantskaya</a> and <a href="https://eng.ed.ac.uk/about/people/professor-ignazio-maria-viola">Ignazio Maria Viola</a>. My reseach is on the simulation and control of bio-inspired microgliders, specifically on designing neural network controllers and investigating robustness and safety properties.</p>
<p>
I have a degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Edinburgh, and previously worked as a software engineering intern at <a href="https://altair.com/">Altair Engineering</a> and <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/wmg/">WMG Warwick</a>.
