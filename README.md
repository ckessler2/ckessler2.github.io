Personal academic and photography site, with photos hosted in repository (not sure if it's a good idea - 38 files totalling 12MB). Written with html + css, since I'm not a web developer and this is a side project.

Visit site here: https://ckessler2.github.io/

Here's my method, in case it's useful:
<ol>
  <li>Create basic html + css site locally, following some tutorial <a href="[url](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/build-a-website-using-html-css)">(example)</a>. I use VS code with the live server extension to preview the site from local files</li>
</ol>
